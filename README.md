# Fluture

A complete Fantasy Land compatible Future library.

## Motivation

* A stand-alone Fantasy Future package.
* Async control utilities included.
* Easier debugging than `f(...).fork is not a function`.
* Working `instanceof` checks.
* Passing around `Future#chain` without having to bind.
* Speed.
